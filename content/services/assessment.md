# Benefits

**Identifying Vulnerabilities:** It helps in identifying potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in your current cyber security posture. By understanding where your organization stands in terms of security maturity, you can prioritize efforts to address the most critical areas.

**Risk Management:** Assessing your cyber security maturity allows you to better understand the risks your company faces concerning data breaches, cyber attacks, and other security incidents. This understanding enables you to allocate resources effectively to mitigate these risks.

**Compliance Requirements:** Many industries have specific regulatory requirements regarding data protection and cyber security. Conducting a maturity assessment can help ensure that your organization meets these compliance standards, avoiding potential legal and financial consequences.

**Resource Allocation:** It helps in optimizing resource allocation by identifying gaps in security controls and processes. This ensures that your investments in cyber security are targeted towards areas where they are most needed, maximizing the effectiveness of your security budget.

**Business Continuity:** Strengthening your cyber security maturity enhances your organization's ability to maintain business operations in the face of cyber threats. By identifying and addressing weaknesses, you can better protect critical assets and ensure continuity in the event of a security incident.

**Reputation Management:** A strong cyber security posture enhances your company's reputation and instills trust among customers, partners, and stakeholders. Demonstrating a commitment to cyber security through regular assessments can differentiate your company from competitors and attract potential clients who prioritize security. 

## Roadmap

Once completed, ROCI Consulting will provide a report and roadmap document with both priority recommendations (usually completed within 6 months) and a longer term roadmap (1-3 years) to improve your organizations Cyber Security posture. This will assist with resource and budget planning.

## CIS Controls

We primarily use the CIS Controls (www.cisecurity.org) for our assessment work. 

The CIS Controls "are a recommended set of actions for cyber defense that provide specific and actionable ways to thwart the most pervasive attacks. The CIS Controls are a relatively short list of high-priority, highly effective defensive actions that provide a “must-do, do-first” starting point for every enterprise seeking to improve their cyber defense."

Although we do have experience with other Cyber Security frameworks if that is required by your organization or regulators.
